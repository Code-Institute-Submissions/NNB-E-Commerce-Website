## Testing

**Note:** All Testing Information can be located in seperate [TESTING.MD File](https://github.com/LouieOHagan/NNB-E-Commerce-Website/blob/master/TESTING.md) due to length of content.

## Deployment

I took the following steps to deploy the project successfully to Heroku.
### Deploying by connecting Github to Heroku

1. Up to the top right of the screen I clicked the "New" Dropdown button and then clicked the dropdown and selected "Create new app".
2. I called the app "nnb-store" and set the region to "Europe".
3. Once my app was created, I chose my deployment method which was "Connect to GitHub".
4. After logging and authenticating my GitHub account, I typed the repository name in to the search bar in the "Connect to GitHub" section and searched for "NNB-E-Commerce-Website".
5. When the repository appeared, I clicked the "Connect Button"
6. Once connected, I selected my master branch in the "Automatic deploys" section and clicked "Enable Automatic Deploys" button to ensure that every time I push to GitHub the app is rebuilt and is always up to date with the latest code.
7. Afterwards I went back to my Gitpod workspace and in my CLI I created a requirements.txt so Heroku knows what dependecies need to be installed for the application to run by running the following command. `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`.
8. I then created a Procfile which Heroku also requires by running the following command. `echo web: gunicorn nnb_store.wsgi:application > Procfile`.
9. I then went through the standard process of pushing these files to Github, which Heroku recognised and rebuilt the app.

Alternatively I could have connected my application through Heroku CLI
### Deploying using Heroku CLI

1. Up to the top right of the screen I would click the "New" Dropdown button and then click the dropdown and select "Create new app".
2. I would then call the app "covid-companion" and set the region to "Europe".
3. Once my app was created, I would chose my deployment method which would be "Use Heroku CLI".
4. Next I would go to my Gitpod workspace and in my CLI I would login in to Heroku using the following command. `heroku login -i`.
5. I would then go back to my Application dashboard and in the settings section I would take the "Heroku git URL" in "App Information".
6. Back in my Gitpod workspace, I would link my repository to Heroku using the following command. `git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/nnb-store.git`.
7. I would then create a requirements.txt so Heroku knows what dependecies need to be installed for the application to run by running the following command. `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`.
8. I would then create a Procfile which Heroku also requires by running the following command. `echo web: gunicorn nnb_store.wsgi:application > Procfile`.
9. Lastly, I would push my application to Heroku which I will have to do manually each time using the following command. `git push heroku -u master`.

### Setting Up Heroku Enviroment Variables

1. In the application dashboard, navigate up the top of the screen and click the "Settings" button in the navigation menu.
2. In the "Config Vars" section, click "Reveal Config Vars" which is where I added my enviroment variables.
3. I then set all the enviroment variables up by adding the variable name to the "KEY" field and the variable value to the "VALUE" field and clicking the "Add" button.
```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = '...'
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = '...'
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = '...'
    DATABASE_URL = '...'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = '...'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = '...'
    SECRET_KEY = '...'
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = '...'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = '...'
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = '...'
    USE_AWS = '...'
```

### Setting up AWS Bucket and Linking to Project
1. In the AWS Control Panel I created an S3 Bucket
2. I installed Django Storages using the command `pip3 install django-storages`
2. AWS was linked to the project in settings.py from line 173 to line 195

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LouieOHagan/NNB-E-Commerce-Website)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
